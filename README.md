# Emotional Blob Tracking for the FILM IKIRU

Ikiru ("To Live") is a 1952 Film by Akira Kurosawa and serves as the canvas for this data driven intervention. The film famously tackles the theme of bureaucracy and how it can cause one to waste their life way. This concept terrifies me, in creative industry the same sentiment rings true. we must envision a break down to the barrier of bureaucratic behaviours and establish open forms of education and accessibility. Data Vision attempts to establish pedagogy and referencing accessibility to amateurs or professionals. Data in this case has the ability to identify characteristics that strip away all redundancy leaving a pure form of expression to be interpretable and hopefully recognisable. I see the themes Kurosawa evokes in his message and believe they reflect the intention a computer has when learning to see for the first time. It transforms into a tool to fight against wasted time. The shaky instability of the detection algorithm mimics the way a child stumbles when learning to walk. In 20 years a quantum computer will be able to detect every wrinkle that appears in this moving image
